Idem 5 - Encrypted Secrets
==========================

Idem 5 comes with a much needed addition, the ability to store encrypted data at
rest. This addition introduces a new dep and project that is used for the work
of encrypted datastore - Takara. Takara is the standalone manager for keeping
track of this data at rest, it allows for data to be easily stored in a pluggable
and dynamic way. Takara has also been app-merged into Idem, so you can initiate,
unseal, and use takara secret data stores from Idem.
